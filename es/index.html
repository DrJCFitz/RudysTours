Truly a unique place to observe the raw regenerative power of the forest as it struggles to claim what was once wild.

            <p>The Panama Canal, nearing its 100th year anniversary, is Panama’s most popular tourist attraction. The best way to experience the canal is in a cruise. During your transit, you will have the unique opportunity to see the Canal up close in operation. You will transit with the big ships and see the tug boats in operation and of course, the locks themselves. You can feel the sensation of going up or down to get from one ocean to the other.

            <p>This tour is to show you the other part of Panama which everybody tends to hide, ignore and forget, where the less fortunate but most authentic people live. We will see the everyday life, history and situation of these places. We will as well visit the best established, largest, most inclusive strongholds of Panamanian capitalism as well as the most popular one for those less fortunate, called Avenida Central.

There are no roads and the town spreads along its palm fingered beachfront full of tropical flowers which can be covered within 25 min., making it an  extremely peaceful place.

            <p>Panama is a rather small country (77,381 sq. km. / 29,762 sq. mi.) and the major attractions are all in Panama City and its surroundings. You have beaches, mountains, lakes, tropical rainforests, the Panama Canal, tax free shopping, history, ruins, bird watching, jungle trekking, deep-sea fishing, diving, snorkeling, marine and biodiversity exhibition centers, excellent restaurants and night life... all at your finger tips;-)  Normally one tends to jump from one place to another within the country with a rental car trying to see as much as possible, wasting a lot of time and accumulating stress instead of…relaxing and enjoying the scenery with me as your guide.
            </p>
            <p>If you want to discover and feel part of this country, combining culture with history, as well as sunbathing at the beach and having fun,  then my recommendation is to stay at least  5 days (a week would be better as some of you will need time to get rid of the jet-lag!) in Panama City and take day tours to the places of your interest. This will save you a lot of time and money and at the same time will let you enjoy Panama's night life enjoying one of Amador’s restaurants with the canal view and ocean breeze, or in Bella Vista neighborhood where you will find the widest selection of restaurants and bars of the city with its casinos and night clubs and just dance away to the salsa and merengue music;-)
            </p>
            <p>To keep a family atmosphere I have decided not to take more then 6 adults (or 5 adults + 2 children) on the same tour, this way I will have more time for each one of you and you will have the opportunity to make friends on the way;-) But if you want to keep the tour  private just for your party then a small nominal fee will apply.
